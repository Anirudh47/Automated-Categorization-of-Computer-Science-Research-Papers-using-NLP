* Number of Authors: The "Number_of_authors" variable showcases that, on average, each entry in the dataset is associated with around 3.74 authors. However, there is noticeable variability in the number of authors per entry, with values ranging from 1 to as high as 445. This suggests a wide range of collaboration patterns among the entries, with some having only one author while others involve a large number of contributors.

* Number of Categories: The "Number_of_categories" variable reveals that, on average, each entry is assigned around 1.91 categories. The distribution of categories per entry is relatively concentrated, with a low standard deviation of approximately 0.76. This indicates that the majority of entries have two or fewer categories assigned to them. It's possible that the dataset primarily focuses on a limited number of categories, with some entries falling outside this trend and having more categories associated with them.

* Title Word Count: The "Title_word_count" variable provides insights into the length of the entry titles. On average, the titles consist of approximately 7.87 words. The distribution of word counts exhibits moderate variability, with a standard deviation of around 2.68. The range of title word counts spans from 0 to 33 words. This suggests that while most titles fall within the 6 to 9-word range, there are entries with shorter or longer titles as well, including some with no words at all.

### The bar chart shows the number of publications based on the months :

We do not see any specific trend in the number of publication based on the months. Almost all the months have around similar number of papers published.

### The bar chart shows the number of publications based on the Week Days :

This is an interesting chart, as we see that most of the papers are published on the weekdays which makes sense as publishing centeres and universities are not working over the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Tuesday is the day, when we see the most number of papers published.
